                <p>In march the Japanese declare French rule at and end in Vietnam and Emperor Bao Dai proclaims &#8220;independence&#8221; in March.</p>
                <p>Aware that victory over the Japanese is near in May the Truman administration recognizes French claims to Indochina in part because of (1) the U.S. need for French cooperation in Washington&#8217;s plans for the reconstruction of Europe
                  following World War II and (2) the growing orientation toward containment as a political/military strategy against communism.</p>
                <p>During the Potsdam Conference in mid-July the allies are convinced that there should be a postwar (WWII) occupation of Indochina by British and Chinese forces in order to forestall independence and return Vietnam to France. At this time
                  the Office ofStrategic Services (OSS) actively supports the Vietminh in their guerrilla war with Japan, and Major Archimedes Patti argues that Washington should recognize the independence of Vietnam.</p>
                <p>In September the Communists secure domination in the Viet Minh with the Independence League seizing power; Ho Chi Minh declares full independence for Vietnam and establishes the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (GRDV) in
                  Hanoi; he appeals to the U.S. for recognition, but receives no response. At this time British forces occupy the Saigon area to take over from the Japanese and begin to rearm the French, and later even the Japanese against the Vietminh.</p>
                <p>On November 22, French troops return to Vietnam, transported in U.S. merchant ships, and sporadically clash with Communist and Nationalist forces.</p>

                  in December with attacks on French troops in the North. Using U.S. vessels the French bombard the port of Haiphong, killing 6,000 civilians, then occupy the port and the city of Hanoi.</p>

                  As food, ammunition, and medical supplies dwindle, France request American intervention. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Radford, the Secretary of State John F. Dulles, and Vice President Richard M. Nixon call for
                  direct American military intervention. However, after discussion with other military advisors, including Army Chief of Staff Gen. Matthew Ridgway, and unable to secure congressional support,, President Eisenhower declines to commit troops.
                  On May 7th the remnants of the French garrison at Dien Bien Phu surrender.

                <p>Faced with defeat on the battlefield, France agrees to a conference in Geneva, including the U.S., France, Britain, China and the U.S.S.R.</p>

                <p>On July 20 and 21, 1954 all parties except the U.S. and South Vietnam sign the Geneva Accords. Though Washington and Saigon refuse to sign, they agree to observe the terms.</p>

                <p>To foster a &#8220;cooling off&#8221; period and separate warring forces, Vietnam is temporarily divided at the 17th parallel; the north to be governed by Communists under Ho Chi Minh, while the south would be governed under Diem, until

                  elections to be held in 1956 to choose the government of the entire nation. Laos and Cambodia to be recognized as independent (Cambodia on September 25th and Laos later in the year). In October President Dwight D. Eisenhower advises
                  Diem that the U.S. will provide assistance directly to South Vietnam, instead of channeling it through French authorities.</p>
                <p>A short time later the Eisenhower administration provides economic and military aid to South Vietnam under the leadership of Diem. This coincides with the establishment of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) on September 7th.
                  The agreement, signed in Manila, was devised to check communist expansion in the region. Although there are no provisions requiring any of the signatories,(U.S., Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines)
                  to provide support for South Vietnam, there is a provision declaring that should South Vietnam be attacked the members would immediately initiate armed force against the &#8220;aggressor.&#8221;</p>

                  prepare for the elections scheduled by the Geneva Accords. However, on July 20th, backed by Washington, Diem announces his refusal to take part in the general elections scheduled for the following year by the Geneva Agreements. The Diem
                  regime argues that free elections are impossible in the Communist North. However, Diem organizes a rigged election in the South and proclaims himself the victor. The U.S. quickly recognizes Diem&#8217;s government as the &#8220;legitimate&#8221;

                Archaeological findings from 1965, still under research, show the remains of two hominins closely related to Sinanthropus, dating as far back as the Middle Pleistocene era, roughly half a million years ago. Ancient Vietnam was home to some of the world's earliest civilizations and societies—making them one of the world's first people who practiced agriculture.

                The Red River valley formed a natural geographic and economic unit, bounded to the north and west by mountains and jungles, to the east by the sea and to the south by the Red River Delta. The need to have a single authority to prevent floods of the Red River, to cooperate in constructing hydraulic systems, trade exchange, and to fight invaders, led to the creation of the first Vietnamese states approximately 2879 BC.

              Another truly influential part of history in Vietnam occurred during the late Bronze Age, when the Đông Sơn culture dramatically advanced the civilization. Vietnam's peculiar geography made it a difficult country to attack, which is why Vietnam under the Hùng kings was for so long an independent and self-contained state. The Xích Tỵs and Qins were among the earliest foreign aggressors of Vietnam, but the ancient Vietnamese managed to regain control of the country soon after the invasions.

              <p>
                Vietnam was part of Imperial China for over a millennium, from 111 BC to AD 939. The Vietnamese became independent in 939, following the Vietnamese victory in the Battle of Bạch Đằng River. Successive Vietnamese royal dynasties flourished as the nation expanded geographically and politically into Southeast Asia, until the Indochina Peninsula was colonized by the French in the mid-19th century. Following a Japanese occupation in the 1940s, the Vietnamese fought French rule in the First Indochina War, eventually expelling the French in 1954. Thereafter, Vietnam was divided politically into two rival states, North and South Vietnam. Conflict between the two sides intensified, with heavy intervention from the United States, in what is known as the Vietnam War. The war ended with a North Vietnamese victory in 1975.

               Vietnam was then unified under a communist government but remained impoverished and politically isolated. In 1986, the government initiated a series of economic and political reforms which began Vietnam's path towards integration into the world economy. By 2000, it had established diplomatic relations with all nations. Since 2000, Vietnam's economic growth rate has been among the highest in the world, and, in 2011, it had the highest Global Growth Generators Index among 11 major economies. Its successful economic reforms resulted in its joining the World Trade Organization in 2007.

                 Former mandarin of the Nguyễn dynasty, a Prime Minister of State of Vietnam led by Bảo Đại since 1954. In October 1955, he announced a victory after a plebiscite, deposed Bảo Đại and established the first Republic of Vietnam (RVN) in South Vietnam. In November 1963, after constant religious protests and non-violent resistances, Diệm was assassinated, along with his brother, Ngô Đình Nhu, by Nguyễn Văn Nhung, the aide of the leader of The Army of Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) General Dương Văn Minh during a coup d'état sanctioned by the US. The assassination led to the end of the US-Diệm alliance and the collapse of his regime as well as the first Republic of Vietnam.

Diệm has been a controversial historical figure in historiography on Vietnam War scholarship. Some historians portrayed him as a tool of the US policymakers, some considered him as an avatar of Vietnamese tradition. Nevertheless, some recent studies have portrayed Diệm from a more Vietnamese centered perspective as a competent leader with his own vision on nation building and modernization of South Vietnam
